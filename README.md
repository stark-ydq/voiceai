> A curated, developer friendly learning path for building real-time voice AI agents from your first STT call to scaling production telephony.

Voice AI has moved from research demos into shipping product in under three years. **The modern stack is converging around a clear pattern**: a real-time transport layer (WebRTC or telephony), a streaming pipeline of speech-to-text → LLM → text-to-speech, and a turn-taking model that decides when the agent should speak. This list is structured to mirror that learning order  start with the foundations, pick a framework, then drill into individual components and production concerns.

Resources are tagged **🟢 Beginner**, **🟡 Intermediate**, or **🔴 Advanced**. Prefer free official docs and vendor-neutral guides; flag where authors have commercial interests.

## How to use this list

Read top-to-bottom if you're brand new. The recommended path:

1. **Foundations** → understand the pipeline and latency budget
2. **Frameworks** → pick one (LiveKit Agents or Pipecat are the safest open-source bets) and ship a hello-world
3. **Components** (STT, TTS, LLM, VAD, turn detection) → swap pieces to learn what each layer does
4. **Transport & telephony** → connect to a real phone number
5. **Evaluation, production, ethics** → make it safe enough to ship
